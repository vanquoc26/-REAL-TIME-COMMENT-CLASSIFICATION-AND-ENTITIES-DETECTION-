 REAL-TIME COMMENT CLASSIFICATION AND ENTITIES DETECTION 

  Description 
This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting and classifying 
entities in online comments on social media platforms TikTok and YouTube. The 
system will utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) models for entity detection, 
along with deep learning and machine learning technologies. It will integrate big 
data processing tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and streaming 
techniques to ensure e ciency and scalability. 
Responsibilities 
•Led the development of a system for entity detection and classi cation 
of online comments on TikTok and YouTube. Managed data collection 
and annotation processes for training datasets.
 •Developed and ne-tuned NER, deep learning, and machine learning 
models.
 •Integrated Apache Spark and Kafka for real-time big data processing 
and streaming.
 •Evaluated and optimized model performance.
 •Deployed the system and ensured its e cient operation.
