 REAL-TIME COMMENT CLASSIFICATION AND ENTITIES DETECTION 

* DESCRIPTION
    - This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting and classifying entities in online comments on social media platforms TikTok and YouTube. The system will utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) models for entity detection, along with deep learning and machine learning technologies.
   - It will integrate big data processing tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and streaming techniques to ensure e ciency and scalability.

* EXPERIMENT & RESULTS
  -  In this section, we analyze and discuss the performance of various models used
 for comment classification and entity detection online. The compared models
 include: NER for entity detection, BERT, PhoBERT, DistilBERT, Logistic Re
gression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. The evaluation metrics considered in
 our analysis are Accuracy and F1 Score. The table below will present our results
 from experiments on the test dataset
